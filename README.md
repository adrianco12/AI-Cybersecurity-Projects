## Projects Overview

## Project 1: Cybersecurity Event Classifier (Logistic Regression)

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify cybersecurity events such as normal traffic, phishing, DoS attacks, and malware. The model is trained on numeric features like packet size, failed logins, suspicious port usage, and connection duration.

**How it works:**
- Each feature is assigned a **weight (coefficient)** during training.
- The weighted sum of features is transformed into probabilities using a **sigmoid function**.
- The model predicts the event type with the highest probability.
- Users can input new event data to see predictions and probability scores.
